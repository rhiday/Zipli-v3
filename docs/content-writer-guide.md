### Best Practices

#### Content Guidelines

2. **Be consistent**: Use the same terminology throughout
3. **Consider space**: Finnish text is often longer than English
4. **Use proper tone**: Professional but friendly

#### Finnish Translation Tips

- Finnish text is typically 20-30% longer than English
- Test important labels to ensure they fit in the UI
- Keep button text especially short
- Use commonly understood terms

### Special Features

#### Variables in Text

Some translations contain variables like `{name}` or `{count}`:

- **Don't remove** the curly braces
- **Keep variable names** exactly as they are
- Place them naturally in your translation

Example:

- English: `Welcome back, {name}!`
- Finnish: `Tervetuloa takaisin, {name}!`

#### Pluralization

Some keys have plural forms:

- `{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}`
- Translate each form appropriately

### Workflow
