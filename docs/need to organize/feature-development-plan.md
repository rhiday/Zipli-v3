# Feature Development Plan

## Overview

This document tracks the development of three key features using short-lived feature branches. Each feature will be developed, tested, and merged to main independently.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **Main Branch**: `main` - Production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived branches for individual features
- **Merge Strategy**: Feature branch â†’ Main â†’ Release

### Feature Branches

1. `feature/finnish-multilingual` - Finnish language support
2. `feature/content-improvements` - Content and messaging enhancements
3. `feature/design-improvements` - Visual design and UI improvements

## Feature Status Tracking

| Feature              | Branch                         | Status   | Progress | Estimated Timeline | Assignee |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Finnish Multilingual | `feature/finnish-multilingual` | ðŸŸ¡ Ready | 0%       | 2-3 days           | -        |
| Content Improvements | `feature/content-improvements` | ðŸŸ¡ Ready | 0%       | 2-3 days           | -        |
| Design Improvements  | `feature/design-improvements`  | ðŸŸ¡ Ready | 0%       | 3-4 days           | -        |

**Status Legend:**

- ðŸŸ¡ Ready to start
- ðŸŸ  In progress
- ðŸŸ¢ Ready for review
- âœ… Completed

## Development Process

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Start working on a feature
git checkout feature/[feature-name]
git pull origin feature/[feature-name]

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [specific feature]"
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

### 2. Testing and Review

- [ ] Feature implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code review requested
- [ ] Documentation updated

### 3. Merge to Main

```bash
# Create pull request from feature branch to main
# After approval and testing:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/[feature-name]
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/[feature-name]
git push origin --delete feature/[feature-name]
```

### 4. Release Process

After all features are merged to main:

```bash
# Tag release
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0: Finnish multilingual, content improvements, design enhancements"
git push origin v2.1.0

# Deploy to production
# (Vercel will automatically deploy from main branch)
```

## Quality Gates

### Before Merge to Main

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified

### Before Release

- [ ] All features merged and tested together
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed
- [ ] Staging environment validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Feature conflicts** - Features may have overlapping changes
2. **Performance impact** - Multiple features may affect performance
3. **Translation quality** - Finnish translations need native speaker review
4. **Design consistency** - Design changes may conflict with content changes

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Regular main branch syncing** - Keep feature branches updated
2. **Performance monitoring** - Test each feature's impact
3. **Professional translation** - Use qualified translation services
4. **Design system adherence** - Follow established design tokens

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups

- Feature progress updates
- Blocker identification
- Cross-feature coordination

### Weekly Reviews

- Feature demo and feedback
- Timeline adjustments
- Quality assessment

### Release Planning

- Feature completion confirmation
- Release timeline finalization
- Deployment coordination

## Success Metrics

### Finnish Multilingual

- [ ] 100% UI text translated
- [ ] Language switching works seamlessly
- [ ] Finnish user engagement increases

### Content Improvements

- [ ] Reduced support tickets for common issues
- [ ] Improved user onboarding completion rates
- [ ] Better user satisfaction scores

### Design Improvements

- [ ] Improved visual consistency scores
- [ ] Better accessibility audit results
- [ ] Enhanced mobile user experience metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Choose first feature** to implement
2. **Assign team members** to features
3. **Set up development environment** for chosen feature
4. **Begin implementation** following the documented plan
