# 📝 Allergen Display Consistency Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide tests the updated allergen display in request details to ensure consistency between input and display format.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Development server running (`npm run dev`)
- Browser with DevTools open

## 🧪 Test Scenario: Input/Display Consistency

### Test: Plain Text Allergen Display

1. **Create Test Request**:
   - Navigate to `/request/one-time-form`
   - Fill form with:
     - Description: `"Food needed for community event"`
     - Quantity: `"12"`
     - **Allergens**: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts, No shellfish"`
   - Complete the flow and submit

2. **Verify Request Details Display**:
   - Navigate to the request details page
   - **Expected Results**:
     - ✅ **Label**: "Allergies, Intolerances & Diets:"
     - ✅ **Display**: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts, No shellfish"` (plain text)
     - ✅ **NOT**: Individual tags like `[Gluten-free] [Dairy-free]`
     - ✅ **Style**: Same text styling as other description fields

### Test: Empty Allergen Field

1. **Create Request with No Allergens**:
   - Create request with empty allergen field
   - **Expected Results**:
     - ✅ No allergen section displayed at all
     - ✅ No empty label or placeholder text

### Test: Edit Flow Consistency

1. **Test Edit Mode**:
   - Click "Edit Request" on request details
   - **Expected Results**:
     - ✅ Form shows: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts, No shellfish"` (as text)
     - ✅ User can modify as plain text
     - ✅ After saving, details page shows plain text format

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Visual Consistency:

- ✅ Input format matches display format (both plain text)
- ✅ No visual disconnect between input and output
- ✅ Clean, readable text display
- ✅ Proper label for clarity

### User Experience:

- ✅ Users see exactly what they typed
- ✅ No confusion about format changes
- ✅ Consistent throughout the flow

### Technical:

- ✅ Database still stores as array: `["Gluten-free", "Dairy-free", "Contains nuts", "No shellfish"]`
- ✅ Display converts array back to text: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts, No shellfish"`
- ✅ Edit mode works correctly

## 🆚 Before vs After

**❌ Before (Inconsistent):**

- Input: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts"` (text field)
- Display: `[Gluten-free] [Dairy-free] [Contains nuts]` (formatted tags)

**✅ After (Consistent):**

- Input: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts"` (text field)
- Display: `"Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Contains nuts"` (plain text)
