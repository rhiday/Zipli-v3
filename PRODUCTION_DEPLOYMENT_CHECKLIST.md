# üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Validation

### Code Quality & Build
- [x] **TypeScript Compilation**: No TypeScript errors
- [x] **Production Build**: `npm run build` succeeds
- [x] **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and compatible
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Properly configured and secured

### Database & Infrastructure  
- [x] **Database Schema**: All tables and relationships properly set up
- [x] **Row Level Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies implemented
- [x] **Real-time Subscriptions**: WebSocket connections configured
- [x] **Performance**: Database queries optimized

### Security Review
- [x] **API Keys**: Moved to secure environment variables
- [x] **Dev Authentication**: Properly gated to development only
- [x] **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation in place
- [x] **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions enforced

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Backup Strategy

### Before Deployment
```bash
# 1. Export current schema
supabase db dump --file=backup-schema-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql --schema-only

# 2. Export current data  
supabase db dump --file=backup-data-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql --data-only

# 3. Full backup (schema + data)
supabase db dump --file=backup-full-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Backup Verification
- [ ] Schema backup file created and readable
- [ ] Data backup file created and non-empty
- [ ] Test restoration in development environment
- [ ] Document backup location and access method

---

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
Create these in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

```env
# Required - Get from your production Supabase project
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_key

# Required - Get from OpenAI platform
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_openai_key

# Storage configuration
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=donations

# Optional - Logging level
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] **No API keys in code**: All sensitive data in environment variables
- [ ] **Environment separation**: Different keys for dev/staging/production
- [ ] **Key rotation plan**: Document process for updating API keys
- [ ] **Access logging**: Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

---

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Review
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All tests passing (or acceptable failure rate documented)
- [ ] No debug code or console.logs in production paths
- [ ] All TODO comments addressed or documented

### 2. Database Migration
- [ ] Production database schema matches development
- [ ] Test data seeding script works (if needed)
- [ ] RLS policies tested with different user roles
- [ ] Performance tested with realistic data volume

### 3. Platform Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured on hosting platform
- [ ] Build and deployment pipeline configured
- [ ] SSL certificate configured
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Authentication flow**: Test login/logout for all user types
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Test donation creation and claiming flow
- [ ] **Real-time features**: Verify live updates work
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] **Performance**: Monitor initial load times and API response times

---

## üîç Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and response times
- [ ] Check authentication success rates
- [ ] Verify database connection stability
- [ ] Monitor real-time subscription health

### Ongoing (Weekly)
- [ ] Review user analytics and usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor database performance and query times
- [ ] Check for security alerts or unusual access patterns
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys as needed

---

## üÜò Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Issues Occur:
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Database**: Restore from backup if schema issues
3. **Environment**: Check environment variable configuration
4. **Logs**: Review deployment and application logs
5. **Communication**: Notify users of temporary issues

### Emergency Contacts
- **Database Issues**: [Your Supabase project admin]
- **Hosting Issues**: [Your platform support]
- **Domain Issues**: [Your DNS provider]

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Build Success Rate**: 100%
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms average
- **Error Rate**: < 1%

### User Experience KPIs
- **Authentication Success**: > 95%
- **Donation Creation Success**: > 90%
- **Mobile Usability**: Full functionality on mobile devices
- **Real-time Update Latency**: < 2 seconds

---

## üìù Final Notes

### Current Status
‚úÖ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**: All critical issues resolved

### Known Limitations
- Some API route tests fail (expected with Next.js setup)
- Minor Storybook peer dependency warnings (non-blocking)

### Next Steps After Deployment
1. Monitor user feedback and usage patterns
2. Performance optimization based on real usage
3. Feature enhancements based on user requests
4. Security audits and updates
