## 📈 **Feature Completeness Score**

| Branch | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `origin/feature/save-wip` | **9/10** | Most complete, best for development |
| `main` | **7/10** | Good base, stable |
| `origin/feature/voice-input` | **6/10** | Great voice UI, but auth breaks dev flow |
| `origin/staging` | **5/10** | Production ready but minimal features |

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **Primary Recommendation: Merge `origin/feature/save-wip`**
**Why**: This branch contains the most comprehensive improvements:
- ✅ Enhanced donation flow with data persistence
- ✅ Better image handling with compression
- ✅ Improved developer experience
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ UI/UX polish and bug fixes

### **Secondary: Extract Voice UI from `voice-input`**
**Cherry-pick**: The circular button styling improvements
**Skip**: The Supabase authentication (breaks development workflow)

### **Tertiary: Review Staging Config**
**Check**: If any staging configurations are needed

---

## 🚦 **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Safe Merge** (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Backup current main
git checkout main
git checkout -b backup-main

# 2. Merge save-wip features
git checkout main
git merge origin/feature/save-wip

# 3. Test thoroughly
pnpm dev
pnpm test
```

### **Phase 2: Voice UI Enhancement**
```bash
# Cherry-pick voice input styling
git cherry-pick <specific-commits-from-voice-input>
```

### **Phase 3: Production Prep**
```bash
# Review staging configurations
git diff origin/staging main
```

---

## ⚠️ **Potential Conflicts**

1. **Authentication System**: `voice-input` uses real Supabase, others use mock
2. **Mock Data**: Different data structures across branches
3. **Component Interfaces**: Minor differences in prop types

**Resolution**: Keep mock system for development, plan Supabase migration separately

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Quick Test Each Branch**:
```bash
# Use the provided script
./test-branches.sh

# Or manually:
git checkout test-save-wip
pnpm dev
# Test donation flow, image upload, dev switcher
```

### **Key Areas to Test**:
1. **Login/Authentication**: Does it work smoothly?
2. **Donation Creation**: End-to-end flow
3. **Image Upload**: File handling and compression
4. **Voice Input**: UI states and functionality
5. **Data Persistence**: Form state across navigation

---

## 🎯 **Final Verdict**

**Best Branch for Immediate Use**: `origin/feature/save-wip`

This branch represents the most mature development state with comprehensive improvements, testing, and developer experience enhancements. It maintains the mock development workflow while adding significant feature improvements and polish.
