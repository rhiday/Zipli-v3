# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The donation forms in the Zipli food donation platform currently have mixed translation support. While the new donation page uses the translation system, the manual donation form and main donation dashboard contain hardcoded English text that prevents Finnish users from having a fully localized experience. This feature will complete the Finnish translation implementation for all donation-related forms and interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Finnish-speaking donor, I want all donation forms to be available in Finnish, so that I can easily create and manage my food donations in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Finnish user navigates to the donation dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all text elements in Finnish
2. WHEN a Finnish user accesses the manual donation form THEN the system SHALL show all form labels, placeholders, and buttons in Finnish
3. WHEN a Finnish user interacts with donation item management THEN the system SHALL display all action buttons and messages in Finnish
4. WHEN a Finnish user views donation statistics and impact data THEN the system SHALL present all metrics and descriptions in Finnish

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Finnish-speaking donor, I want consistent translation quality across all donation interfaces, so that the user experience feels professional and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation keys are missing from the translation file THEN the system SHALL add appropriate Finnish translations
2. WHEN existing translations need improvement THEN the system SHALL update them to be more natural and contextually appropriate
3. WHEN new UI elements are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they use the translation system from the start
4. WHEN form validation messages appear THEN the system SHALL display them in the user's selected language

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the donation system, I want all donation forms to use the centralized translation system, so that future updates and new languages can be easily supported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardcoded text exists in donation components THEN the system SHALL replace it with translation keys
2. WHEN new donation-related text is added THEN the system SHALL use the translation system consistently
3. WHEN translation keys are defined THEN the system SHALL follow the existing naming conventions
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain translation functionality without breaking existing features
